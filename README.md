# Creative-Computing
## What is physical computing
Physical computing involves interactive systems that can sense and respond to the world around them. While this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control electro-mechanical devices such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware. (From Wikipedia)

## What is Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

## Simulation
In class, I tried to complete a simple circuit. For this circuit I will use a lot of different materials. Because it was my first try, I was worried that I would make a mistake. However, I could clearly know what I should do at each step by viewing the tutorials and videos.
We need to use the Arduino Uno, the breadboard, some jumper wires, a 220 ohms resistor, a switch and an LED. The line needs to start from the positive and return to the negative. During the combination process, the first simulation failed because the switch was not installed properly. Fortunately, we found the problem in time and made corrections.
I also tried some circuit connections on the website, which is a more convenient way of learning. You can complete the simulation without carrying a real object.

## What is Markdow
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

I tried some simple code with Markdown

## Reflection
It is rare to accumulate knowledge and skills through practice. Through this practical operation, I think there are many possibilities for physical computing. From this learning, I feel the charm of science and technology. If it can be combined with the design, it will be very helpful to improve the design outcomes.
In fact, I think some art creation has been realized by relying on electronic technology. For example, some animation designs that need projection to show, some architectural designs that need 3D modeling. Physical computing can help us achieve many ideas or design outcomes that are difficult to achieve.
I don't know much about programming. This is what I really want to learn in the future. Through programming, you can create more interesting designs. Your design results are not limited to a piece of paper. You can design web pages and design programs to guide people to see what you want to show. I think the process of completing a web design may be a little boring, but when you complete it, you will get a great sense of achievement and happiness.
With the progress of the times, science and technology are also developing rapidly. Creation is the most powerful ability that human beings have at present. Our design can use the help of technology, but it can never be imitated by technology.
